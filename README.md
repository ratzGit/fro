Project Fro aims to develop an Uber-like app to take outstation trip orders.
The final output of this app should have the following features:
1. Uber like interface where the customers can see maps. 
2. They will have the ability to select the number of members travelling.
3. Based on the number of travellers, the app will suggest the type of the vehicle.
4. The app will then ask to select start point and destination; users can opt for a one way trip.
5. The screen should have a text box with a button for launching Map, if unable to find via text.
6. The same screen should have the option for selecting the dates.
